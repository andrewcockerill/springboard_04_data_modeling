## Data Modeling Exercise

### Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a data modeling exercise to demonstrate and explore database normalization principles. This exercise is divided into two sections:

- Part 1) Schema Design: This section involves brainstorming of data models given a set of requirements. A visual for each schema is presented in the <tt>docs</tt> section of this repository.
- Part 2) Schema Critique: This section pertains to an evaluation of a proposed schema that combines all available data elements into a single, non-normalized table. This schema is then adjusted to a new model that is in line with normalization standards.

Schema setup and data population is carried out by means of a PostgreSQL database.

### Folder Structure
- <tt>src</tt>: Contains Python and SQL code needed to generate all tables
- <tt>notebooks</tt>: Includes a notebook file that explores all tables in Parts 1 and 2.
- <tt>docs</tt>: Contains pdf documents of the proposed schemas for Part 1.
